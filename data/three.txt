how to manage and set up the canteen menu within the SFU Learn system. Below is a breakdown of the key points:
1. Setting Up the Canteen Menu:
    • The canteen menu must be set up and managed through the SFU Learn Backend System.
    • A category for the canteen menu must be created first. This helps organize menu items based on their type (e.g., "Everyday", "Pre-order").
    • For each category, the admin must ensure it is set up correctly for visibility, and items within the category can be activated or deactivated.
2. Adding Menu Categories:
    • To add a new menu category:
        ◦ The admin needs to enter a category name and assign a rank (which determines its position in the menu).
        ◦ The category can be activated or deactivated based on its availability.
3. Adding Menu Items:
    • After setting up the category, the admin can proceed to add individual menu items.
        ◦ For each menu item, the following details must be filled out:
            ▪ Name: The name of the item.
            ▪ Price: The cost of the item.
